		<h3 class="self-intro">Self Introduction:</h3>
			<p>Good day! My name is Maria Jessica J. Lupig, a 21-year-old student from Boac, Marinduque, Philippines. I am currently taking a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Marinduque State College. I took this program to achieve my dream of becoming a successful game developer in the future. I mostly dedicate my time to learning different programming languages and gaming. Apart from that, I also love to write literary pieces, read novels and manga, watch anime and documentaries, sing, dance, and make playlists.</p>

			<h4 class="info-tech">Background on Information Technology:</h4>
				<p>Information Technology (IT) is often associated with the computer systems, hardware, software, and networks related to the processing and distribution of data. These include networking hardware, such as servers and routers, and applications that allow communication over a variety of networks and the Internet at large (CISCO, n.d.). Throughout my three-year coding journey, I have developed a great comprehension of the fundamentals of computer science and information technology. The continuous act of building functional systems—from blueprint to debugging—has improved my knowledge, honed my skills, and enhanced my technical expertise. It has shown me the importance of balancing theory with application in the field of technology.</p>
